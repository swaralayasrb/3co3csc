  <p>RoseMatta rice (also known as Palakkadan/Kerala Matta rice, or Kaje Rice) (Malayalam: കേരള മട്ട, Tulu:കജെ അരി) is an indigenous variety of rice grown in the Palakkad district of Kerala, India.[1] It is known for its coarseness and health benefits. It is popular in Kerala and coastal Karnataka in India and Sri Lanka where it is used on a regular basis for idlies, appams and plain rice; it is different from brown rice. The robust and earthy flavour of Red Matta makes it suitable to accompany lamb, beef or game meats.[2][3]</p>
  <p> Health benefits: With high fibre content and a low glycaemic index (compared to polished white rice), Palakkadan Matta or Rosematta is one of the healthiest Indian rice varieties. It is also high in magnesium and vitamins A and B.</p>
