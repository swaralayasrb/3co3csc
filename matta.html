  <h1>Matta</h1>
  <p>RoseMatta rice (also known as Palakkadan/Kerala Matta rice, or Kaje Rice) (Malayalam: കേരള മട്ട, Tulu:കജെ അരി) is an indigenous variety of rice grown in the Palakkad district of Kerala, India.[1] It is known for its coarseness and health benefits. It is popular in Kerala and coastal Karnataka in India and Sri Lanka where it is used on a regular basis for idlies, appams and plain rice; it is different from brown rice. The robust and earthy flavour of Red Matta makes it suitable to accompany lamb, beef or game meats.[2][3]</p>
